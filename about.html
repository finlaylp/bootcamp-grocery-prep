            <h1>About Me!</h1>
            <p>Hi, my name is Finlay, I'm a third year SE major who is very mid-tier at cooking.
                I like to go outside as much as I can, lift weights, play guitar, and play some video games when I have the time.
            </p>
            <h2>My food experience</h2>
            <p>I grew up with 3 siblings and it was very important to my parents to have sit down meals, so as a child all of my food was cooked for me.
                When I was like 8 years old I actually would only really eat fish sticks and mac and cheese (dw things have changed since then) and one time 
                my grandma bought fish sticks for me when we went to visit (in germany) but I refused to eat them since they were the wrong brand. I know I was 
                a little brat.
            </p>
            <p>But as I got older, I would start to pay attention to my parents while they were cooking, and now
                after learning by example I am pretty well trained to cook a variety of decent meals.
